# table
A webapp, written in Node.js using Socket.IO, that lets you store information in a spreadsheet-like table.  All changes are immediately written to a server-side database and propagated to all clients in real time.

The table is responsive and mobile-friendly so that, unlike Google Sheets, you can edit the table on a mobile device without having to install a separate app.
